### React
The choice of React comes with the SPA nature of this type of application designed to render views and easily convert between web or mobile. The reusability of the components and modularity was also key, as we wanted the application to be able to be iterated over by future open source developers. Also, React has the capabilities of server side rending, allowing developers to utilize the Vitual DOM without needing to update the view every time. 

### MongoDb
The use of MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability in managing the diverse data requirements of our application. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB efficiently handles semi-structured data, such as user profiles, book listings, and exchange transactions, without the need for predefined schemas. Its document-based model allows for seamless integration of nested and dynamic data structures, making it ideal for evolving requirements. The ability to index and query large datasets with high performance ensured efficient retrieval of books and user-related data, supporting the application's search and filtering functionalities. Additionally, MongoDB's scalability and horizontal scaling capabilities make it a robust choice for future growth and increasing user demand.

### Bcrypt
Bcrypt was an ideal choice to encrypt the passwords for our users, as we felt its unique salt hashing system would add increased security, and also an easy framework for hashing passwords exponentially more if warranted. 

### Node / Express
Node and Express was chosen to keep â€œlanguage consistency" between front and back end. It is a cross-platform runtime environment built on V8, high-performance open-source JavaScript engine, ensures excellent performance in an event-driven, non-blocking I/O paradigm.
